/// Generates the 6-digit confirmation number that the user needs to enter in the browser when authenticating with the offline QR Code Factor, after they approve the authentication or transaction request.

/// This method with the `SDKPin` argument was designed for the case when the app is offline, the SDK is configured with `LockConfigurationTypeSDKPinWithBiometricsOptional`, and the user presence was validated using the SDK Pin.
///
/// The callback response returns the following errors:
/// - `FTRLockErrorInvalidOperation` if the SDK lock configuration type is other than `LockConfigurationTypeSDKPinWithBiometricsOptional.`
/// - `FTRLockErrorIllegalArgument` if any of the specified values are invalid.
///
/// - Parameters:
///     - QRCode: Provide string directly from scanned QR code image.
///     - SDKPin: The SDK Pin inserted by the user
///     - error: A pointer to an error object. If an error occurs, this pointer is set to an actual error object containing the error information. You may specify nil for this parameter if you do not want the error information.
/// - Returns: A six digit code in string format. In case any error occurs the method will return nil (objective-c). In Swift, this method returns a nonoptional result and is marked with the throws keyword to indicate that it throws an error in case of failure.
